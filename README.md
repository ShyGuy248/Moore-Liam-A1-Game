There are 10 questions, all multiple choice, and if you get 5 of them correct you win.
However, if you wish to answer with a letter, it must be uppercase.
If you answer with the actual answer, it must all be in lowercase.
For all the answers, they can be found here: (https://smilingfriends.fandom.com/wiki/Smiling_Friends_Wiki)
The person guiding you through the questions is the character Charlie, and the text is designed to have similar mannerisms to him.
